MindHue Front-End (Phase 2)

This is the front-end portion of my MindHue full stack project.
The app allows users to track their emotions through color-coded mood entries.
Each entry includes a mood label, color, note, and timestamp.

Features
- Add new mood entries using a color picker, dropdown, and note box
- View a list of all saved moods displayed with chosen colors
- Built with React (using useState and useEffect hooks)
- Prepares to connect with a Node.js + Express backend and MongoDB database

Project Info
Phase 2 focuses on building and styling the React front end.
Later phases will include the backend and database connection.

note: This project was created using Create React App. The base files (index.js, App.css, etc.) were automatically generated by React. I wrote and customized the code inside App.js for my MindHue front-end design.
